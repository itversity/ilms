    "* All the programming languages have robust pre-defined functions.\n",
    "* Pre-defined function means the function which is available out of the box.\n",
    "* We can leverage these functions to add key functionalities required as part of our application.\n",
    "* As part of our applications, typically we read the data from databases or files. Also data is typically passed as part of requests (REST APIs)\n",
    "* Once data is read from databases or files, we process the data. This is where the pre-defined functions comes handy.\n",
    "* After data is processed, either we save the data back to database or files or provide responses to requests such as REST API requests.\n",
    "* Even though there are thousands of pre-defined functions as part of Python as well as Python based libraries, let us explore most common ones to begin with.\n",
    "  * Numeric Functions\n",
    "  * String Manipulation Functions\n",
    "  * Date Manipulation Functions\n",
